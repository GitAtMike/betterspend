## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18+
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) on your phone (for mobile)

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GitAtMike/betterspend.git
cd betterspend
npm install
```

### Run

```bash
# Mobile (iOS/Android via Expo Go)
npx expo start

# Web
npx expo start --web
```

For mobile, scan the QR code with Expo Go (Android) or the Camera app (iOS).

## Data Persistence

BetterSpend uses a platform-specific storage strategy:

- **iOS/Android** — SQLite via `expo-sqlite` with WAL journaling for performance
- **Web** — `localStorage` via `src/db.web.ts`, automatically selected by Expo's Metro bundler

Both layers expose the same async API (`initDb`, `addTransaction`, `getAllTransactions`, `updateTransaction`, `deleteTransaction`, `setBudget`, `getBudgets`, `removeBudget`), so all screens work identically across platforms with no conditional logic in the UI.

All data is stored locally on the user's device. No accounts are required and no data is transmitted to any server.
